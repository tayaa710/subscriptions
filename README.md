# Subscription Sentinel

Subscription Sentinel is a Chrome extension that spots free trials and recurring billing terms while you browse checkout pages. When it detects a subscription, it saves the details locally and schedules notifications so you get reminded before the renewal hits.

## Features

- üîç **Automatic detection** ‚Äì A content script scans the current page for free-trial lengths, billing amounts, and renewal cadence.
- üß† **Smart reminders** ‚Äì Detected subscriptions are stored in `chrome.storage.local` and reminders are scheduled using `chrome.alarms` and `chrome.notifications`.
- üìã **Quick overview** ‚Äì The popup shows every tracked subscription, including trial terms, billing cadence, and the next reminder timestamp.
- üöÄ **Just-in-time prompts** ‚Äì When you submit a relevant checkout form or click a ‚Äústart trial‚Äù style button, the extension opens its popup automatically so you can confirm saving the entry.
- üßπ **Simple management** ‚Äì Remove subscriptions you no longer need directly from the popup.

## Project structure

```
manifest.json        # Extension manifest (MV3)
background.js        # Service worker handling storage, alarms, and notifications
contentScript.js     # Page analyzer that scrapes subscription language
popup.html/.css/.js  # Popup UI for viewing and managing saved subscriptions
```

## How detection works

1. The content script walks visible text nodes on the page (up to ~2‚ÄØkB) and runs a few regular expressions looking for:
   - Free-trial durations (e.g., ‚Äú14-day free trial‚Äù).
   - Billing amounts tied to a cadence (e.g., ‚Äú$12.99 per month‚Äù).
   - Generic cadence language (e.g., ‚Äúbilled annually‚Äù).
2. Matches are normalized to capture the duration (in days) and billing period.
3. After you interact with the checkout flow (e.g., submitting the form or clicking a ‚Äústart trial‚Äù button), the data is sent to the background service worker, which deduplicates entries per URL, stores them, and schedules notifications.
4. Reminders fire one day before the computed rollover. If a billing cadence is available, the reminder recurs on that cadence.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Detection is heuristic based. For checkout flows rendered inside iframes or heavily scripted experiences, it may miss some offers. You can still add them manually by browsing to confirmation pages or using the popup once support is added.

## Installation

1. Open **chrome://extensions** in Chrome.
2. Toggle **Developer mode** (top-right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and choose this project folder.
4. Navigate to a subscription checkout page and complete the sign-up action (e.g., click ‚ÄúStart free trial‚Äù). The extension will spot the language, prompt you with the popup automatically, and schedule notifications.

## Testing the detection heuristics

### Using the bundled demo page

1. From this repository, run a lightweight web server:
   ```bash
   cd test-site
   python -m http.server 5500
   ```
2. Visit <http://localhost:5500> in Chrome and click **Start free trial**. The content script detects the subscription language, the popup opens automatically (just like a password manager prompt), and the entry appears in the list for review.

### Crafting your own test page

You can also create a simple HTML file with subscription language and load it via a `file://` URL. Include phrases like
‚Äú7-day free trial‚Äù or ‚Äú$9.99 per month‚Äù so the regexes latch onto them.

## Privacy

All subscription data lives in `chrome.storage.local` and never leaves your device.
